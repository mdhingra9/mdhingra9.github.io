<p>"The truth is you don't know what is going to happen tomorrow. Life is a crazy ride, and nothing is guaranteed" by Marshall Bruce Mathers III (Eminem: Oct 17,1972 - present)</p>
<h2>Biography of Eminem</h2>
<p>Eminem is an American rapper, record producer, and actor. He was born on October 17,1972, in St. Joseph, Missouri. He didn't really know much about his father as his father left the family when Eminem was an infant. His mother, Deborah Mathers raised him alone, trying to find small jobs. This reason made Eminem move many times and change schools. He was alone as he didn't have many firends and was often bullied. This resulted in physical abuse (using prescription drug) and emotional abuse. Finally, he had to drop-out high school. His struggle in life and his anger helped him create successful music. Even though he had ups and downs in life(and career), he managed to go through all obstacles and became a successful person, today.</p>
